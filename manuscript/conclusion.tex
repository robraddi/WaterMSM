\section{Conclusion}

Using \textasciitilde{}976 µs of trajectory data simulated in explicit
solvent, an MSM of p53-MDM2 binding was constructed via solvent shell
features, offering a complementary, solvent-based view of protein
conformational dynamics. We find that the solvent feature-based MSM
exhibits a landscape very similar to that found in a previously
published MSM constructed from MDM2-p53 protein atom pair distances.
Calculating instantaneous water density over all trajectories ultimately
revealed that the largest contributions to solvation and de-wetting
during the binding are within \textasciitilde{} (3-6) Å of Thr18 and
Lys24 of p53.~The significance of Thr18 in the binding dynamics arises
from its reorganization in the binding site to maximize polar
interactions with water.~ Lastly, the hydrophobic effect was reaffirmed
and visually displayed in atomic detail, using water density surfaces to
illuminate water mediation and water clusters leaving the binding site.
