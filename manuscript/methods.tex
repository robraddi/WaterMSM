\section{Methods}

\textbf{Molecular Dynamics}

Molecular simulation trajectories of \emph{ab initio} peptide binding
were performed on Folding@home (FAH) \cite{larson2009folding} using Gromacs 4.5.4 \cite{hess2008gromacs} with
TIP3P explicit solvent and the Amber ff99sb-ildn-nmr force field, as
described by Zhou et al \cite{zhou2017bridging}. The protein data bank (PDB) denotes the
well-known MDM2-p53 system as 1YCR. Initial atomic coordinates from 1YCR
were used as a template in the production of approximately 976 µs of
aggregate simulation data.

\textbf{Solvent Shell Featurization}

Previously, the analysis of trajectories consisted of strictly protein
conformational degrees of freedom (DOF). Pair distance features between
$C_{\alpha}$ and $C_{\beta}$ atoms of selected residues
(see Supplementary Materials) positioned within the binding region of
MDM2 and p53 were used. In contrast to the distance metric between
$C_{\alpha}$ and $C_{\beta}$ atoms in Zhou's work, each
trajectory was described by the "SolventShellFeaturizer'' tool for
MSMBuilder \cite{harrigan2015conserve}. We deemed $C_{\alpha}$ and $C_{\beta}$ atoms as solute atoms and water oxygens as solvent atoms.

Solvent features are a collection of all the water oxygens that had been
binned in accordance to their respective shell occupancies around solute atoms.
``Important'' water atoms are defined as the solvent atoms located in
the union of two or more shells with differing solute atoms. Parameters
for the solvent shell featurization followed the optimization determined
by Harrigain et al., \cite{harrigan2015conserve} which encompasses the use of four solvent
shells around each solute atom with a shell width equal to 3.0 Å each.

\textbf{MSM construction}

In recent years, MSMs have proven to be a strong tool in many
sectors of biophysics, including protein folding \cite{lane2011markov,voelz2012slow},
conformational dynamics \cite{zhou2017bridging}, as well as solvent dynamics \cite{harrigan2015conserve} {\color{red}Add more citations here}. We
describe solvent dynamics using WetMSM \cite{harrigan2015conserve}, MDTraj \cite{mcgibbon2015mdtraj} and MSMbuilder
\cite{harrigan2017msmbuilder} libraries. Using the latter python libraries, linear combinations
of solvent features were used to compute a new basis set, the tICA
subspace. The eigenvectors of the tICA time-correlation matrix relate to
the degrees of freedom associated with the conformational change \cite{bowman2013introduction}.
Hence, the metastability of specific solvent shells contributing to the
slowest de-wetting processes were determined from the eigenvectors
correlated with the slowest relation timescales.

Previous model selection by Zhou et al \cite{zhou2017bridging} shows that 10 tICA components with 600 microstates and a 5 ns lagtime is best suited for the construction of the
protein-only tICA model. In order to compare protein and solvent MSM's,
the tICA parameters remained the same in the wetMSM \cite{harrigan2015conserve} construction.

\textbf{MolMap }

Chimera's molmap \cite{pettersen2004ucsf} function allows for visualization of specific
water density within trajectories. Molmap is an effective approach to view ``important''
solvent-protein interactions. We selected all water-oxygens for each snapshot when computing the density surface. The following parameters results in a surface that encapsulates volume with the absence of water.  The initial contour level to enclose a fraction of the total mass was set to 0.9895 and the grid spacing to 1.3. The volume contour level was then changed to 0.015 to apply Gaussian filtering. Gaussian filtering was performed for each individual surface in order to reduce the amount of flickering when
moving from snapshot to snapshot.
