%% Meta-data block
%% ---------------
%% Each author should be given as a separate \author command.
%%
%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author
%% name as an \email command. Phone and fax numbers can be given
%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional.
%%
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each
%% \affiliation command applies to all preceding authors not already
%% assigned an affiliation.
%%
%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This
%% will typically be something like "University of Somewhere".
%%
%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc.
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.

%\end{equation}

%\paragraph{Reference potentials.}
%The correct implementation of reference potentials is an important advantage of the BICePs algorithm. The experimental data used to construct the %likelihood function comes from some set of ensemble-averaged experimental observables $\mathbf{r} = (r_1, r_2, ..., r_N)$. Such observables are %low-dimensional projections of some high-dimensional state space $X$, and therefore these restraints in the space of observables need to be treated as %\textit{potentials of mean force}.\cite{Olsson:2013gq,Olsson:2011kl,Hamelryck:2010dea}

%\subsection{Restraint}
%The \verb|Restraint| class initializes all necessary functions to construct numpy array containing information for BICePs sampling. As a parent class, %it also includes child classes for different experimental restraints. Upon initialization, the algorithm will collect all input raw data and %corresponding experimental values for each experimental observable in each state. Meanwhile, $\chi^2$ values and reference potentials (see Theory) for %each restraint are computed at this step.

%P(X | D) \propto\left[\frac{Q(\mathbf{r}(X) | D)}{Q_{\text { ref }}(\mathbf{r}(X))}\right] P(X)
