	Annote = {Molecular dynamics with explicit solvent  using MSMs and "solvent-shells featurization" for including solvent degrees of freedom.
Solvent shells featurization--->
The features are the solvent shells, where `important' water molecules can be found by locating the water molecules that have been binned in a solvent shell of two or more atoms simultaneously.  These are binned based on the radial distances from each solute atom. 

Solvent shell featurizer script can be found under ``wetmsm'' on Mathew Harrigans's github page:  https://github.com/mpharrigan/wetmsm

partial_transform(self, traj) will featurize a trajectory using the solvent shells. 

Using tICA, we can ``find a set of linear combinations of input features which define ``components'' to serve as a new basis set for the data.''  
Projecting the input features on the top n slowest tICs ---> dimensionality reduction.},
